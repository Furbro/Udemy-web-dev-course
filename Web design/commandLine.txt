ls
    prints out folders and files from the root directory
cd
    change directory; use ls to check which directory you are in and start typing the filepath you want to navigate.
    e.g from mofr2@Genruga MINGW64 /c I would use the followig code to navigate to the koding directory; $ cd Users/mofr2/Documents/koding
cd ~
    Used to take you back to your root directory.
cd ..
