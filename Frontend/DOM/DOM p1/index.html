  <!-- This is a way of writing javascript inline; pro tip: AVOID: <body onload="alert('Hello there govenor!')"> 
    this way of writing javascript is a pain in the ass to debug and essentially bad practice! -->

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // This is another way of writing javascript, having it load with the website.
      alert("hello there govenor");
    </script>

    <!--
    The placement of the script matters a whole lot!
    eg. if the js changes an element that does not exist, the code will not execute.
    As a conclution we can say that the script:src should be placed last, so the page loads faster.
